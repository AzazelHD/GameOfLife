Conway's Game of Life.

Scenario behaves like a Torus, i.e., borders are all comunicated.

You can click cells to swap between dead or alive state. Once you have set up your desired initial state, feel free to click "Start" button.

"Random" button is disabled while game is running, to avoid deleting user initial state.

The "Speed" slider is the delay in milliseconds between each update.
